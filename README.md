# Digital Clock

These are the files for a digital clock built for fun and learning purposes with CMOS digital logic integrated circuits. I had started this back in summer 2023 but got sidetracked and eventually picked it back up near the end of summer 2024.

## Features
- 7 segment LED display
- Setting the time
- AM/PM Indicator
- Binary counter displaying the seconds

## To-do
- [x] Make Logic Diagram (Logisim)
- [ ] Make Schematic (KiCad)
- [x] Find and Purchase Components
- [ ] Program EEPROM
- [ ] Build Clock Prototype
- [ ] Build Display Prototype<br>
Tentative:
- [ ] Design PCB
- [ ] Assemble PCB
